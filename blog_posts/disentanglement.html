Welcome to the very first blog post on Pixel Bending! In this post, we'll begin our series on disentanglement, a
somewhat nebulous but extremely exciting and active research topic in machine learning. This first post will present
an intuitive (and interactive!) overview of disentanglement; it should be a fairly gentle introduction. Part two of the
series covers the Hessian Penalty, our new algorithm for tackling disentangling. Let's dive right in!

<h1>What does disentanglement even mean?</h1>

<div class="z_slider">
    <p>\(G(\)</p>
    <input value="0" data-thickness=.4 class="dial" data-fgColor="#5487ff" data-angleOffset=-125 data-angleArc=250 data-rotation=anticlockwise>
    <p>\(,\)</p>
    <input value="0" data-thickness=.4 class="dial" data-fgColor="#5487ff" data-angleOffset=-125 data-angleArc=250 data-rotation=anticlockwise>
    <p>\() =\) </p><div class="emoji">üî•‚ùÑÔ∏è</div>
</div>

<p>In what may initially seem like a complete digression from discussing disentanglement (and pixels), we're going to talk about shower handles.
If you're like me, most showers you've used had just a single knob. Turning that knob ever so slightly will
release some freezing-cold water at a low water pressure. Turn it a bit more and both the temperature and water pressure will increase.
With this kind of shower knob, it's impossible to take a shower with cold water at a low water pressure or to take a shower
with hot water at a low water pressure. We can think of this knob as <i>entangling</i> water pressure with temperature; there's no way to "independently" change just one factor without inadvertently changing the other.</p>

<p>
    Let's try to make this silly (but surprisingly informative!) example a tiny bit more formal. We'll refer to the value
    our knob is set to as \(z\). For example, \(z = 0\) means the shower is turned off, whereas \(z = 1\) means
    that we've cranked-up the knob as much as we can. Then, we'll define \(G\) to be a function that takes as input \(z\)
    and outputs the state of the shower. In our example, that means \(G\) produces two outputs; a number that
    describes the water pressure of the shower and a second number that describes the temperature of the water. Try
    setting various various values of \(z\) below (visually represented as a shower knob) to get a sense of what
    \(G\) is doing:

<h1>Finding a disentangled shower</h1>

The question now turns to how we can incentivize the manufacturer to give us our disentangled knobs.
You might ask, "Can't we just tell them that we want a shower where one
knob controls water pressure and a second knob controls temperature?" We actually could do that, but for reasons we'll
talk about in the next section,

What do we have to tell the manufacturing company to ensure that they deliver
us a nice "disentangled" shower; one where we can freely control the temperature and pressure factors? Well, since there are only
two factors, maybe all we need to tell them is that we want a shower with two knobs! But to our dismay, this is the shower they shipped us:

Yikes! We got our shower with two knobs, but the left controls amount of cold water while the right controls amount of hot water.
This gives us a bit more control than before---now we can have a hot shower with low water pressure---but we can no longer
have a hot shower at maximum water pressure. What went wrong here? Unfortunately, having a number of knobs equal to the
number of factors isn't enough to guarantee that we get a disentangled shower.

Time to bring-in some machine learning!

<h1>Manipulating images with disentanglement</h1>

Water pressure and temperature --> variables in our data
The shower manufacturing company --> a generative model that learns to reproduce the data
The shower knobs --> the knobs that provide an input to our generative model

At some point while reading this, you may have asked yourself, "Why didn't we just tell the manufacturer that we want one
knob to control water pressure and one knob to control temperature?" Well, we actually could have done that in this
specific example since we knew beforehand the only two factors of variation that we care about.

When it works, disentanglement is a little bit magical; it lets your generative model automatically learn
very useful features and functions that you did not explicitly train them to construct. To give a concrete example, try
out this demo that transforms human drawings of edges into photorealistic images. The method used to do this is Pix2Pix,
a supervised learning algorithm that learns to map edges to its ground-truth label (the correspond real image).
It turns out that when we train a boring old GAN---regularized with a certain disentanglement algorithm---our generator learns
a z component that does Pix2Pix's job! Increasing the z knob makes the image look more photorealistic (while preserving the structure),
while decreasing it throws-away texture and leaves only edges! But we got other useful knobs, too, like a knob
that makes shoes taller when increased; this is something Pix2Pix can't do since we didn't have labels that described
each shoe's height. In other words, disentanglement automatically gave us multiple Pix2Pix models,
and we didn't even need to use explicit labels to train them! Another example is the Sentiment Neuron Paper. The tl;dr is that they trained an unsupervised generative network that produces language,
and their model automatically learned a sub-network that controls the sentiment of the output text. In short, disentanglement
can remove the need for labels, when it works at least.

<h1>On Disentanglement Algorithms</h1>

The trouble, of course, is that designing useful disentanglement algorithms is challenging, and algorithms that work on
one dataset or model may not work well on others. Perhaps more fundamentally, the research community hasn't even
converged upon a formal definition of disentanglement yet! Although I've tried to give an intuitive illustration
of disentanglement in this post, you may be frustrated that I didn't present a clear objective or evaluation metric.
I'm a bit frustrated by it, too! Doing research in this area can be tricky, and a lot of it boils down to looking at
our models and trying to visualize what they have learned, not particularly unlike the shower knob examples from the
beginning of this post. Despite these roadblocks, there is quite a lot of existing disentanglement literature. I've
included a very, very small subset of this research below if you're interested in finding out more.

That wraps up the first blog post on Pixel Bending (turns out disentanglement is a great way to "bend" pixels!).

regularization function for tackling disentanglement in arbitrary neural networks.
